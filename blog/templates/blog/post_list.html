            <h2><a href="">My second post</a></h2>
            <p>From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Guadeloupe
I will follow you wherever you may be
From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Have to hold you in my arms now
There can never be another for me
All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica, say you'll be mine
Can you feel the heat of passion?
Can you taste our love's sweet wine
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow's cares right out of your mind</p>
